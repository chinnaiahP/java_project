# java_project

Doing experiments and new projects while learning a programming language is really fun and exciting. We are going to make a simple ATM machine project using java programming. ATM stands for Automated Teller Machine. It's possible to make a complete functional ATM project and GUI in java. But we are going to make a simple one

In our simple ATM project, the user can deposit money, withdraw, check account balance, and exit from the ATM program.

#Key Features of the ATM Machine project:

=>The java Program can Display the ATM Transaction
=>The user can deposit money from this ATM Machine project
=>The user can withdraw cash from this ATM Machine project
=>The user can check the bank account balance
=>ATM users can deposit money to the bank by choosing the deposit option. The java program will simply get the deposit amount from the user and add the money to the user's account.

Users can withdraw money from their bank account through the program by selecting the withdrawal option. After a successful transaction, the ATM machine will deduct the amount from the central bank account.

The user can also check their existing bank account total balance using the checking account balance option.
Finally, the exit option will simply exit the users from the ATM machine program and return the user to the default main menu.
